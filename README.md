Verify R code submissions and auto-generate meaningful feedback messages.
Originally developed for R exercises on DataCamp for so-called Submission Correctness Tests, but can also be used independently.

- If you want to learn what SCTs are and how they work, visit [this article](https://instructor-support.datacamp.com/courses/course-development/submission-correctness-tests) specifically.

## Installation

```R
library("devtools")
install_github("hrdg/testwhat")
```

## Demo

Experimenting locally:

```R
library(testwhat)
setup_state(sol_code = "x <- 5",
            stu_code = "x <- 4")

ex() %>% check_object("x")
# No error: x is defined in both student and solution code

ex() %>% check_object("x") %>% check_equal()
# Error: The contents of the variable `x` aren't correct.

# Debugging state
s <- ex() %>% check_object()
s                     # only prints out state class
str(s)                # full overview of state
s$get("student_code") # access student code in state
```

## Tests

`testwhat` currently depends on the proprietary `RBackend` and `RCompletion` packages to run tests. Tests run automatically on every branch that is updated through travis.

```R
devtools::test()
```

## Documentation

Whenever a push is done to the `master` branch, this repo will automatically build a `pkgdown` website (containing reference documentation and vignettes), push it to the `gh-pages` branch, which in turn is served by GitHub at https://datacamp.github.io/testwhat.
